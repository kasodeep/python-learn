Text Generator which generates the next word.
We are going to use Supervised Learning.

Problem 1:
How we will convert data-set where there is mapping of input and output.

Problem 2:
We need to convert text to numbers, basically vectorization.

Problem 3:
It is a classification task and not regression.
We are going to use multi-class classification.

We are going to have 3 layers:
1. Embeddding: It will provide dense vector. (Better Representation)
2. LSTM
3. Dense
