Long Term Memory is known as Cell State(c[t]).
Short Term Memory is known as Hidden State(h[t]).

Inputs:
   Prev Cell State.
   Prev Hidden State.
   Input for the Current Time Stamp.

Outputs:
   Current Hidden State.
   Current Cell State.

Processing:
   1. Update Cell State.
      a. Remove.
      b. Add.
   2. Calculate ht.

Gates:
   1. Forget Gate - To remove something from Cell State.
      a. Calculate f[t].
      b. c[t] = c[t-1] x f[t].

   2. Input Gate - To add something to Cell State.
      a. Calculate Candidate Cell State from tanh. (Potentail Information to be added).
      b. Calculate i[t] from sigmoid. (Decides what to add from Candidate to Cell State).
      c. c[t] = c[t] + (bar) c[t] x i[t].
   
   3. Output Gate - To calculate Hidden State.
      a. Calculate tanh(c[t]).
      b. Calculate ot from sigmoid.
      c. h[t] = tanh(c[t]) * o[t].

Both ht and ct are vectors of the same dimensions and equal to number of nodes.
There is always concantination of h[t-1] and x[t] for sigmoid function.

Pointwise Operators (Red):
   x: Pointwise Multiplication.
   +: Pointwise Addition.
   tanh: Pointwise tanh.

Neural Network Layers (Yellow):
   Number of nodes in each layer is dynamic, also known as hyperparameter.
   All layers have the same number of nodes.
